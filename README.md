▪ A description of the extra work
for extra work,
* i offered 7 user inputs instead of 2 
* i used randomness to make the leaf of the lettuce appear more natural, as the real thing doesn’t have a specific shape.
* i used randomness to make the spots on the toast, this was difficult because i had to ensure they didn’t get too big or come out of the bread rectangle.
* i made a 'S'TART  button, which is the first thing a user sees before the simulation 
* and i made an instructions panel at the top left of the page, so that the users don’t get confused
